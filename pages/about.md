My name is Daniele Zanni and I am a **Javascript full stack expert** based in London, UK.

My focus is on the **Front End Development** of **scalable applications** and I am a big fan of the **[MEAN stack](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and)** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS). 

I am a believer in **TDD** (Test Driven Development) and **CI** (Continuous Integration), building maintainable applications and cross-browser compatible user interfaces for the web.

At work, I love to build single page applications, breaking and fixing Javascript libraries, playing with **RESTful APIs** and writing **responsive web  applications** using **accessible HTML**.

If you wish to contact me, please drop me an email at *`info@dzanni.com`*.
