This is the first post of this blog in which I aim to collect my coding notes and projects and I feel obliged to spend a couple of words talking about me.

My name is Daniele Zanni and I am an Italian Software Developer based in London, UK. I moved here at the end of 2013, after spending four years in the beautiful city of [Oulu, Finland](https://goo.gl/maps/smtS9) working at the Computer Engineering Department of the University of Oulu.

In time,  I have specialised in Javascript development.
