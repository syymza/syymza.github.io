This is the first post of this blog in which I aim to collect my coding notes and projects and I feel obliged to spend a couple of words talking about me.

My name is Daniele Zanni and I am an Italian Software Developer based in London, UK. I moved here at the end of 2013, after spending four years in the beautiful city of [Oulu, Finland](https://goo.gl/maps/smtS9) working at the Computer Engineering Department of the University of Oulu.

Today I consider myself a **Javascript full stack expert**, with a focus on the **Front End Development** of **scalable applications**, a big fan of the **[MEAN stack](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and)** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS), and one who loves to experiment and try new things. 

I am a believer in **TDD** (Test Driven Development) and **CI** (Continuous Integration), building maintainable applications and cross-browser compatible user interfaces for the web.

At work, I love to build single page applications, breaking and fixing Javascript libraries, playing with **RESTful APIs** and writing **responsive web  applications** using **accessible HTML**.

A computer engineer by trade, focusing on **Human-Computer Interaction**, **User Experience** and **Usability** with an eye on **Web standards**.
